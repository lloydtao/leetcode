"""
Design a stack that supports push, pop, top and retrieving the minimum element in
constant time.

Implement the MinStack class:
- MinStack() initializes the stack object.
- void push(int val) pushes the element val onto the stack.
- void pop() removes the element on the top of the stack.
- int top() gets the top element of the stack.
- int getMin() retrieves the minimum element in the stack.

You must implement a solution with O(1) time complexity for each function.

    """Keep track of the current minimum at any given point. We can either:
    1. Store the current minimum alongside each value as it's added (stack of tuples)
    2. Create a second stack with the minimums (e.g. [4, 2, 3, 1, 5] -> [4, 2, 1]), and
    pop from it if we remove the minimum from the main stack.

    The second approach should theoretically use equal or less memory, as it will store
    up to n minimums for n inputs (â‰¤ 2n), as opposed to exactly n minimums (2n).
    However, memory overheads for lists and tuples make this benefit unclear. I'm going
    to use tuples as we won't need a conditional to remove from second stack (cleaner).
